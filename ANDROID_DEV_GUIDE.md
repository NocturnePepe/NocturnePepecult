# 🌙 NocturneSwap - Android Codespaces Development Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (Android Codespaces)

Since you're on Android Codespaces without npm/node, here are **3 ways** to run the development server:

### Method 1: Python HTTP Server (Recommended)
```bash
cd /workspaces/NocturnePepecult/frontend
python3 -m http.server 3000
```
Then open: `http://localhost:3000/dev.html`

### Method 2: Custom Dev Server
```bash
cd /workspaces/NocturnePepecult
python3 dev-server.py
```
Then open: `http://localhost:3000`

### Method 3: Direct File Access
Open the file directly in VS Code's Simple Browser:
- Go to `frontend/dev.html`
- Right-click and select "Open with Simple Browser"

## 📱 What's Available

The `dev.html` file includes:
- ✅ Full NocturneSwap UI (Home, Swap, Pools, Admin)
- ✅ React Router navigation
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Demo data and mock interfaces
- ✅ No build process required!

## 🔧 Features Working

### 🏠 Home Page
- Welcome message
- Quick navigation to Swap and Pools
- Demo mode indicator

### 🔄 Swap Page
- Token pair listings
- Price change indicators
- Placeholder for swap interface

### 🏊 Pools Page
- Liquidity pool information
- TVL and APR data
- Pool statistics

### ⚙️ Admin Page
- DEX statistics dashboard
- Volume and fee metrics
- User analytics

## 🌐 Accessing Your App

1. **Local Development**: `http://localhost:3000/dev.html`
2. **Port Forwarding**: If using Codespaces, VS Code will automatically forward port 3000
3. **Simple Browser**: Use VS Code's built-in browser to view the app

## 🔄 Making Changes

To modify the app:
1. Edit `frontend/dev.html` directly
2. Refresh your browser to see changes
3. No build process needed!

## 📝 Development Notes

- All React components are included in the single HTML file
- Uses CDN versions of React and React Router
- CSS is embedded for styling
- Mock data is included for demonstration

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you have npm/node available:
1. Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
2. Use `npm start` for the full development experience
3. Access at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If port 3000 is busy:
```bash
# Use a different port
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then access: http://localhost:8000/dev.html
```

If Python is not available:
```bash
# Check what's installed
which python3
python3 --version
```

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Frontend UI complete
- ✅ Navigation working
- ✅ Android Codespaces compatible
- ⏳ Wallet integration (needs npm)
- ⏳ Smart contract integration (needs Anchor)
- ⏳ Real data feeds (needs APIs)

**Happy coding! 🌙✨**
