# Mobile Responsive Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed ‚úÖ
The token selection buttons were overflowing outside the swap container on mobile devices, making the interface unusable on smaller screens.

## Solution Implemented üõ†Ô∏è

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Token Input Layout**: Changed from horizontal to vertical stacking on mobile
2. **Button Sizing**: Token select buttons now use full-width on mobile  
3. **Proper Spacing**: Added gaps and padding for better touch interaction
4. **Responsive Breakpoints**: Added specific styles for 768px and 480px screens
5. **Container Constraints**: Ensured all elements stay within the swap container

### Technical Details:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .token-input {
    flex-direction: column;  /* Stack vertically */
    align-items: stretch;    /* Full width */
    gap: 10px;              /* Proper spacing */
  }
  
  .token-select {
    width: 100%;            /* Full width buttons */
    text-align: center;     /* Centered text */
  }
}
```
